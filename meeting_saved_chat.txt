18:10:58	 From  Jharna Barapatrey : Can you please post the folder names here?
18:11:07	 From  Brandes Moore : Will do.
18:11:38	 From  Brandes Moore : NSS Data Analytics (Main Folder)
18:11:47	 From  Brandes Moore : Sub Folders are as follows:

18:12:00	 From  Brandes Moore : class_data
18:12:09	 From  Brandes Moore : class_exercises
18:12:14	 From  Brandes Moore : projects
18:12:36	 From  Brandes Moore : Your git assignments that we'll clone later will be saved in the "projects" folder
18:13:28	 From  Jharna Barapatrey : Thank you Brandes
18:13:38	 From  Brandes Moore : anytime
18:14:20	 From  Kristen Lucas : Ah sorry my internet went out for a second!
18:16:24	 From  Brandes Moore : *helpful_hint*use the underscores in the folder names. you'll see why later
18:17:23	 From  Brandes Moore : data
18:18:13	 From  Jharna Barapatrey : Nothing
18:34:16	 From  Dustin Bowen : I think you can change your font size in the terminal as well
18:39:54	 From  Bethany Dillingham : im hitting tab and it does nothing?
18:41:07	 From  mark koivula : I created the local folders under This PC / documents, but in GitBash console ls command doesn't see the folders
18:41:39	 From  Drew Konig : check in OneDrive in the directories, that's where mine defaults to from the quick links
18:42:10	 From  Drew Konig : so mine is pc/OneDrive/documents/nss_data_analytics
18:52:26	 From  mark koivula : I'm fixed now, I hope... 
19:07:23	 From  maureencaballero : So what is the relationship of Git Bash to Git Hub?
19:18:56	 From  Daniel Newton : will you need to match the casing in bash exactly to the casing that is on your computer for it to recognize it? would you be able to use an all lowercase 'nss_data_analytics' or would it have to be 'NSS_Data_Analytics' for bash to recognize the command?
19:19:42	 From  Dustin Bowen : bash is case-sensitive
19:20:14	 From  Kristen Lucas : Thanks Dustin!!! That will help when deciding what to name future files!!
19:22:26	 From  Kyle Yandow : https://classroom.github.com/a/oGhNhhqr
19:22:30	 From  Daniel Newton : Is it industry norm to make everything lower case to make it that much easier when using bash commands and to use the underscore _ instead of spaces when naming to avoid having to use ' ' as well?
19:29:28	 From  Jessica Morrison : It is also under “tonights agenda” in slack
19:30:09	 From  Kristen Lucas :  https://classroom.github.com/a/oGhNhhqr
19:30:21	 From  Kristen Lucas : Will the link work here?
19:30:36	 From  mark koivula : I was able to access it from the link in chat
19:31:26	 From  Kristen Lucas : Great! I hope that helps if you can't access Slack at the moment Ayesha!
19:36:43	 From  Brandes Moore : raise your hand in the zoom channel if you're at the point where Urleaka is
19:48:01	 From  Brandes Moore : if you're not there, send up a smoke signal in the participants section (red x, thumbs down, etc)
19:48:40	 From  Lydia Tsang : mine said not found
19:50:42	 From  Ayesha Mobeen : I'm having the same problem
19:51:43	 From  Jessica Morrison : I’m caught up now
19:53:07	 From  Brandes Moore : When you want to paste your assignment link, don't use Ctrl + V to paste, instead use the right-click button on your mouse and then Enter
19:56:08	 From  Daniel Newton : pwd
19:56:47	 From  Daniel Newton : sorry, that was meant to put into my bash...I'm playing around with git bash lol
19:59:23	 From  Philip Campbell : And were pasting into the project directory, correct?
20:00:11	 From  Brandes Moore : yes, you should be in the projects folder/directory
20:00:42	 From  Brandes Moore : it will look something like the following:MINGW64 ~/Documents/NSS_Data_Analytics_Cohort_2/Projects
20:00:49	 From  Philip Campbell : Thank you!
20:03:50	 From  Brandes Moore : raise your hand in the participants window if you need help
20:05:50	 From  Jessica Morrison : thank you for teaching us!
20:05:57	 From  Ayesha Mobeen : Thank YOU!!
20:05:58	 From  mark koivula : indeed, thanks!
20:06:09	 From  Brandes Moore : you guys are awesome
20:08:08	 From  Bethany Dillingham : maybe I missed it but what does ls stand for? or does it matter?
20:08:38	 From  Will McWilliams : list directory
20:08:54	 From  Bethany Dillingham : got it
20:11:27	 From  Daniel Newton : should we put this excel spreadsheet in on of our folders after we download it?
20:15:32	 From  mark koivula : do we save the .xls to the projects folder, or to the repository folder ( Nashville_website_searches… )?
20:16:09	 From  Kristen Lucas : Yeah I think she said to save to that one
20:18:30	 From  mark koivula : thanks Kristen!
20:18:35	 From  Brandes Moore : you should be saving it to the Nashville_website_searchesfolder
20:18:52	 From  Kristen Lucas : sure thing :)
20:34:27	 From  Drew Konig : is there a faster way to drag a formula down to row 36000?
20:35:06	 From  Will McWilliams : Absolutely, what have you tried so far?
20:35:38	 From  Drew Konig : dragging from F2 and holding, it accelerates, but it still takes a minute
20:36:40	 From  Will McWilliams : Try going to the first cell in the column, hold the control button and tap the down arrow
20:39:07	 From  Drew Konig : looks like you can double click the blue square at the bottom right also, never getting those 5 minutes dragging back haha
20:40:08	 From  Bethany Dillingham : i just selected the column, is that giving me false data?
20:41:08	 From  Will McWilliams : Im sorry im not sure what youre asking
20:50:03	 From  Will McWilliams : https://exceljet.net/
20:52:25	 From  Drew Konig : for #20, are we replacing the Rank coulumn that we already did in G with the Volume column?
20:54:38	 From  Will McWilliams : Not sure, I would go over a column from G and make a new column
20:55:05	 From  Drew Konig : thanks
20:57:05	 From  Will McWilliams : So I just look at my project, I moved the rank over a column and put the "Volume" values in column G
20:57:20	 From  Will McWilliams : I feel like its dealer's choice though
